# Instruments
FM
----
*Prototype: [instrument](#prototypes-instrument)*

The FM object pairs two oscillators (with one modulating the frequency of the other) with an envelope and a filter. The envelope controls the amplitude of the modulator (also known as the modulation index) , the overall gain of the synth (volume), and the cutoff frequency of the filter, making its sound perceptually brighter when the envelope is fully open. The synth's envelope also controls the amount that the modulator's output affects its own frequency (feedback).


#### Properties ####
### FM.cmRatio ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 2, range: 0.01-20.  This controls the ratio between the carrier and modulation frequencies. When a note is trigger on this synth the frequency is assigned to the carrier oscillator; the frequency is then multiplied by this property and assigned ot the modulator.
### FM.index ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 5, range: 0.01-20.  This property value, multiplied by the frequency of the carrier oscillator, determines the amplitude of the modulating oscillator.
### FM.feedback ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0, range: 0-1.  The modulating oscillator can direct its output to modulate its own frequency, resulting in chaotic and noisy sounds.
### FM.carrierWaveform ###
*string* default: saw.  Controls the waveform of the carrier oscillator. Options include 'saw', 'triangle', 'pwm', 'sine', and 'square'.
### FM.modulatorWaveform ###
*string* default: saw.  Controls the waveform of the carrier oscillator. Options include 'saw', 'triangle', 'pwm', 'sine', and 'square'.
### FM.antialias ###
*boolean* default: true.  When set to true, the synth's oscillators will use higher-quality (but more CPU expensive) anti-aliasing oscillators.
### FM.frequency ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 220, range: 40-8000.  This is the frequency that will be used when the .trigger() method is called, or if you call .note() and pass no argument. Calls to .note() (assuming you pass an argument) will set the value of this property.
### FM.loudness ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 0-1.  Loudness linearly controls the output of the signal. In addition, in the FM instrument it also affects the cutoff frequency of the instrument's filter (assuming a filter is active), the amplitude of the modulator, and the amount of feedback applied to the modulator. All these effects correspond to much more complex timbres as the instrument gets louder.
### FM.attack ###
*duration*  The attack property controls the duration it takes for the synth to reach full volume after triggering. The duration is written in measures. A value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measure.
### FM.decay ###
*duration*  The decay property controls the length of time it takes for the synth to decay to silence after reaching full volume during its attack phase. The duration is written in measures e.g. a value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measure.
### FM.sustain ###
*duration*  The sustain property controls the length of time the synths envelope stays at steady state after the attack and decay of the envelope have completed. The duration is written in measures e.g. a value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measure.
### FM.release ###
*duration*  The release determines the amount of time the envelope takes to fade to zero after the sustain portion is complete. The duration is written in measures e.g. a value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measurei.
### FM.shape ###
*string* default: linear.  Controls the shape of the synth's envelope stages. Choosee between 'linear' and 'exponential'.
### FM.useADSR ###
*boolean* default: false.  When false, the synth uses a two-stage envelope where durations are determined by the attack and decay properties. When true, the synth uses a four-stage envelope.
### FM.cutoff ###
*number__sequencable* default: 0.5, range: 0-1.  The cutoff property provides a base for determining the cutoff frequency of the filter. The frequency is additionally affected by the envelope of the synth, multiplied by the filterMult property.
### FM.Q ###
*number__sequencable*  The Q property (also commonly known as resonance) determines the sharpness of the filter. This is canonically accompanied by a boost around the cutoff frequency; if the Q property is high enough this boost can turn into self-oscillation.
### FM.filterMult ###
*number__sequencable* default: 2, range: 0-10.  The filterMult property determines how much the cutoff frequency is affected by each synth's envelope. The default value of 2 means that a cutoff frequency would move between .25 and .5 over the course of the envelope.
### FM.filterType ###
*number* default: 1.  The filterType property determines what filter modeling algorithm is used. 0 means no filter is applied to the synth, 1 uses a Moog Ladder Filter, 2 uses  a TB303-style diode filter, 3 uses a state variable filter, and 4 uses a biquad filter design.
### FM.filterMode ###
*number* default: 0.  The filterMode property determines the type of filtering employed, however, some filter types do not support highpass or bandpass filtering. 0 = lowpass, 1 = highpass, 2 = bandpass.
### FM.saturation ###
*number__sequencable* default: 0.5, range: 0.5-20.  Saturation is a waveshaping distortion that is part of the TB303 diode filter model (filterType 2). This property will have no effect for any other value of filterType.
### FM.gain ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0.5, range: 0-1.  This linearly controls the overall output (sometimes known as volume) of the instrument.
### FM.panVoices ###
*boolean* default: true.  When set to true the instrument can be panned through the stereo sound image, adding a slight amount of computational expense.
### FM.pan ###
*number__sequencable* default: 0.5, range: 0-1.  Controls the position of the sound between the left / right speakers or headphones. A value of 0 means the sound is panned to the left, a value of 1 meanns the sound is panned to the right, while .5 is centered.
### FM.glide ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 1-4000.  The glide property controls a single-pole lowpass filter on the frequency, causing notes to slide from one to the next (portamento). The filter equation is: y (n) = y (n-1) + ((x (n) - y (n-1))/glide). A value of 1 generates no glide, a value of 1500 generates a substantial glide.
Pluck
----
*Prototype: [instrument](#prototypes-instrument)*

A physically modeled string instrument, using the Karplus-Strong model.


#### Properties ####
### Pluck.blend ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 0-1.  A feature of the model used for this instrument is that it is easy to randomly add noise to the signal. Values slightly less than 1 will produce notes that sound almost errant, while values closer to .5 will produce bursts of noise and can be a useful percussive texture.
### Pluck.decay ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0.97, range: 0-1.  Controls the time it takes for each note to fade to silence.
### Pluck.damping ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0.2, range: 0-1.  Controls the amount of high frequency damping, or brightness, of the sound.
### Pluck.frequency ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 220, range: 40-8000.  This is the frequency that will be used when the .trigger() method is called, or if you call .note() and pass no argument. Calls to .note() (assuming you pass an argument) will set the value of this property.
### Pluck.loudness ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 0-1.  Loudness linearly controls the output of the signal. In this instrument, there is no difference between loudness and gain.
### Pluck.gain ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0.5, range: 0-1.  This linearly controls the overall output (sometimes known as volume) of the instrument.
### Pluck.panVoices ###
*boolean* default: true.  When set to true the instrument can be panned through the stereo sound image, adding a slight amount of computational expense.
### Pluck.pan ###
*number__sequencable* default: 0.5, range: 0-1.  Controls the position of the sound between the left / right speakers or headphones. A value of 0 means the sound is panned to the left, a value of 1 meanns the sound is panned to the right, while .5 is centered.
### Pluck.glide ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 1-4000.  The glide property controls a single-pole lowpass filter on the frequency, causing notes to slide from one to the next (portamento). The filter equation is: y (n) = y (n-1) + ((x (n) - y (n-1))/glide). A value of 1 generates no glide, a value of 1500 generates a substantial glide.
Monosynth
----
*Prototype: [instrument](#prototypes-instrument)*

The Monosynth object pairs three oscillators, an envelope, and a filter. The envelope controls both the gain of the synth (volume) and the cutoff frequency of the filter, make it's sound brighter when the envelope is fully open. Oscillators can be detuned from each other creating a fuller sound than a single oscillator alone.


#### Properties ####
### Monosynth.antialias ###
*boolean* default: true.  When set to true, the synth's oscillators will use higher-quality (but more CPU expensive) anti-aliasing oscillators.
### Monosynth.detune2 ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 0.005, range: -1-1.  The frequency for oscillator #2 will be determined by taking the value of the .frequency property (which controls the frequency of oscillator #1) and offsetting it by the the value of this property multiplied by the base frequency. So, if the base .frqeuency property was 1000 Hz, oscillator #2 would run at a frequency of 1005 Hz using the default value of .005
### Monosynth.detune3 ###
*number(sequencable)* default: -0.005, range: -1-1.  The frequency for oscillator #3 will be determined by taking the value of the .frequency property (which controls the frequency of oscillator #1) and offsetting it by the the value of this property multiplied by the base frequency. So, if the base .frqeuency property was 1000 Hz, oscillator #2 would run at a frequency of 1005 Hz using the default value of .005
### Monosynth.frequency ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 220, range: 40-8000.  This is the frequency that will be used when the .trigger() method is called, or if you call .note() and pass no argument. Calls to .note() (assuming you pass an argument) will set the value of this property.
### Monosynth.loudness ###
*number(sequencable)* default: 1, range: 0-1.  Loudness linearly controls the output of the signal. In addition, in the Synth instrument it also affects the cutoff frequency of the instrument's filter (assuming a filter is active), so that louder sounds also sound brighter.
### Monosynth.waveform ###
*string* default: saw.  The waveform used by the synth's oscillator. Options include 'saw','sine','triangle','square', and 'pwm'.

### Monosynth.sustain ###
*duration*  The sustain property controls the length of time the synths envelope stays at steady state after the attack and decay of the envelope have completed. The duration is written in measures e.g. a value of 1/4 means one quarter of a measure, a value of 1 means 1 measure.
### Monosynth.release ###

### Monosynth.Q ###
*number__sequencable*  The Q property (also commonly known as resonance) determines the sharpness of the filter. This is canonically accompanied by a boost around the cutoff frequency; if the Q property is high enough this boost can turn into self-oscillation.
### Monosynth.filterMult ###
*number__sequencable* default: 2, range: 0-10.  The filterMult property determines how much the cutoff frequency is affected by each synth's envelope. The default value of 2 means that a cutoff frequency would move between .25 and .5 over the course of the envelope.

### Material.shininess ###
*float* default: 0.  This determines how soft or hard the edges of specular highlights are. More 'shiny' surfaces will have harder edges and are indicated by higher values.
### Material.fresnel ###
*vec3* default: (0,1,2).  he Fresnel effect changes the color of a geometry based upon the angle it is viewed at. This vector contains three values: x is bias, or an offset for the effect; y is scale, or a multiplier for the effect; z an coefficient that exponentially controls the effect of reflectance.
Texture
----
A texture can be applied to a geometry in order to pattern its surface; it can also be used as a lookup table for bump mapping. Unlike materials, every texture has a relatively unique set of properties depending on the algorithm used for the texture. However, the majority of texture will have a 'scale' property which determines the resolution of the texture; many will also have a 'strength' property that scales the effect of the texture on the final color of the geometry (lighting and material also affect this).


#### Properties ####
### Texture.scale ###
*float* default: 1.  The scale property determines the size, or resolution, of the texture. For example, when 'dots' texture is assigned to a cube with a scale of 10 there will be 10x10 dots on each side of the cube. A scale value of 1 will yiled a single dot centered on each side.

# Postprocessing 
Antialias
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The Antialias effect smooths jagged edges in images using the Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA) algortihm. The construtor accepts a numerical argument which determines the number of times the algorithm will be applied; each application requires a complete render stage so it's best to use values < 10, or even < 5.


#### Properties ####
### Antialias.repetitions ###
*int* default: 1.  How many times to apply the antialias effect. This property can *only be set in the constructor; it is not runtime editable.*
Bloom
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The Bloom effect creates blurred glow effects in areas of the scene that are brighter than a specific *threshold* property.


#### Properties ####
### Bloom.threshold ###
*float* default: 0.  Pixels with a brightness value above the threshold property will be spread their brightness to adjacent pixels, creating a glow effect.
### Bloom.amount ###
*float* default: 0.01.  The amount to boost the brightness of pixels that this effect operates on. High values (above 2) will result in blurred offsets that create duplicate images.
Blur
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The Blur effect... blurs the final image on both axes. This operation can be repeated multiple times via the `.repetitions` argument to the constructor, and the number of samples used in the blur can also be increased in the constructor. Increasing these values will create a higher quality blur at an increased computational expense. The blur can cheaply be expanded by simply using the `.amount` property, which can be freely modified at runtime.


#### Properties ####
### Blur.amount ###
*float* default: 0.01.  The amount to boost the brightness of pixels that this effect operates on. High values (above 2) will result in blurred offsets that create duplicate images.
### Blur.repetitions ###
*int* default: 2.  How many times to apply the blur effect. This property can *only be set in the constructor; it is not runtime editable.*
### Blur.taps ###
*int* default: 5.  The number of neighboring pixels that are sampled to genereate the blur. The available options are 5,9, and 13. This property can *only be set in the constructor; it is not runtime editable.*
Brightness
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The `Brightness` effect increases/decreases the overall brightness of the scene based on the `.amount` property.


#### Properties ####
### Brightness.amount ###
*float* default: 0.25.  Values above 0 increase the original brightness of the scene, values below 0 decrease it.
Contast
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The `Brightness` effect increases/decreases the overall contrast of the scene based on the `.amount` property.


#### Properties ####
### Contast.amount ###
*float* default: 0.5.  Values below 1 decrease the original contrast of the scene.
Edge
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The `Edge` effect finds the edges of images using the [sobel operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator), potentially resulting in a stylized, cartoonish effect result.


#### Properties ####
### Edge.mode ###
*int* default: 0.  The mode property sets what algorithm is used by the Edge filter, with one of three possibilities: 0 - Classic Sobel edge detection; 1 
Focus
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

`Focus` is used to create a depth-of-field effect, where parts of the image that are currently in focus (according to the value of the `.depth` property) will appear crisp, while the rest of the image is blurred.


#### Properties ####
### Focus.depth ###
*float* default: 0.  Given a value of 0, objects far from the camera will be blurred. Given a value of 1, objects close to the camera will be blurred.
### Focus.radius ###
*float* default: 0.01.  How much of the image is in focus. Larger areas will result in mmore of the image being crisp at the specified depth level.
Godrays
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

`Focus` is used to create a depth-of-field effect, where parts of the image that are currently in focus (according to the value of the `.depth` property) will appear crisp, while the rest of the image is blurred.


#### Properties ####
### Godrays.decay ###
*float* default: 1.  How fast the rays fade as they travel from their source. Values higher than `1` will create feedback that can quickly overwhelm a scene.
### Godrays.weight ###
*float* default: 0.01.  Multiplies the original background colors; higher values lead to brighter rays. This property expects very low values, typically between 0-.02.
### Godrays.density ###
*float* default: 1.  How close samples are together.
### Godrays.threshold ###
*float* default: 0.9.  Controls at what depth (where 1 is the farthest visible depth) the rays begin.
Hue
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The `Hue` effect shifts the hue of objects below a provided depth threshold. Using the default threshold value of .99 the scene will be inverted while the background retains its original color. With a threshold value of 1 the background color will also be changed.


#### Properties ####
### Hue.threshold ###
*float* default: 0.99.  Object fragments with a depth below this number (where depth is normalized to be between 0â€“1) will have their color shifted, other parts of the scene will be unaffected. A depth of .99 should usually keep the background color the same while changing the rest of the scene.
### Hue.shift ###
*float* default: 0.5.  The amount to shift the hue in the HSV color space.
Invert
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The `Invert` effect inverts the color of objects below a provided depth threshold. Using the default threshold value of .99 (really, any value lower than 1) the scene will be inverted while the background retains its original color. With a threshold value of 1 the background color will also be changed.


#### Properties ####
### Invert.threshold ###
*float* default: 0.99.  Object fragments with a depth below this number (where depth is normalized to be between 0â€“1) will have their color inverted, other parts of the scene will be unaffected. A depth of .99 should usually keep the background color the same while changing the rest of the scene.
MotionBlur
----
*Prototype: [postprocessing](#prototypes-postprocessing)*

The `MotionBlur` effect can be used to create everything from subtle blurring based on movement in the scene (similiar to the blurring created by 'real-life' movement) to trippy feedback fun.


#### Properties ####
### MotionBlur.amount ###
*float* default: 0.7.  The amount of feedback used to create the blur effect. Values above `.9` can be quite fun and experimental, while lower values can be used to create pseudo-realistic blurring around moving objects.
